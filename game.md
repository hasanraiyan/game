### **Simple 3D Game Features for "3D Exploration"**

---

### **Features**:

1. **Player Movement**:  
   - Control the player using **W, A, S, D** keys for forward, left, backward, and right movements.  
   - Optional support for mouse look (camera rotation using mouse movement).

2. **World Design**:  
   - A simple 3D environment with a grid or terrain (flat or procedural generation).  
   - Includes basic 3D models for obstacles, platforms, and environmental elements.

3. **Camera Controls**:  
   - Use the mouse or keyboard for camera control, enabling free exploration or fixed perspectives.

4. **Collision Detection**:  
   - Basic collision detection between the player and static or dynamic objects to prevent movement through obstacles.

5. **Lighting and Shadows**:  
   - Implement simple lighting (ambient, directional, and point lights) to give depth to the 3D world.  
   - Basic shadow effects to enhance realism.

6. **3D Model Loading**:  
   - Load 3D models for the player, environments, and obstacles (e.g., .gltf or .obj formats).  
   - Optionally add animations for player movement and interactions.

7. **Basic UI**:  
   - Minimal HUD elements like health bars, coordinates, and simple menus for options or interactions.

8. **Physics Engine**:  
   - Basic physics for movement and object interaction such as gravity, friction, and object manipulation.
